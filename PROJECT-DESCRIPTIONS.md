Project Descriptions:

HIGHLIGHTED PROJECTS - These are the projects that I am most proud of, the descriptions of which can be found with a ** next to them all of which are C++:

KNearestNeighbors

KMeansClustering

LinearRegression



C++:

**  KNearestNeighbors: While doing research on different machine learning algorithms, I noticed that most machine learning libraries were written only for Python. Noting that, I challenged myself to write a machine learning algorithm ,"K-Nearest-Neighbors" or KNN, from scratch using only C++. This program takes the data from a csv file of data for over 500 breast cancer tumors, and based on the data, determines whether a tumor is malignant or benign. The program creates "points" from each tumor, and places the first 95% points (practice points) from the dataset and graphs them on a normalized scale. Then, it tests itself by attempting to classify the last 5% of points (test points) from the dataset. It does this by taking the Euclidean distance for the data columns of each test point to all of the practice points. Then, based on a specified value "k", it takes the labels of the "k" nearest points, and determines the category (malignant/benign) of the test point based on which label has more instances within the "k" nearest points. In the program's current state, it classify tumors with an average of ~96-97% accuracy. While this program is not perfect, it shows the potential of machine learning (and more sophisticated algorithms) in the future and how it can be used in healthcare.
  
**  KMeansClustering: Another machine learning algorithm that I coded from scratch in C++. This program is similar to KNN, but rather than classifying points based on every training point, centroids are created and centered in data clusters. Whichever label is most common in that data cluster is what the centroid is then classified as, and the label of the closest centroid to the point to be classified is what the label of the point is predicted to be.
  
**  LinearRegression: Another machine learning algorithm that I coded from scratch in C++. This project contains a class that can fit a line, plane, or hyperplane to a set of data using regression techniques, and contains a main.cpp file for an example run. The adjustments to the coefficients of the line/plane are calculated using gradient descent and partial derivatives.

  NeuralNetwork: This project is also from made from scratch in C++, and is a work in progress. The network adjusts the weights of connections between structs called neurons to determine probabilities, such as the probability of a written character being a certain number, or of a cat being in a picture. It is not functional yet, as I am still working on the backpropogation methods.

  FRC2020: This folder contains the code written for my high school's First Robotics Competition (FRC) robot. I wrote the code with a team of five people (I have omitted all portions of the code that I did not write myself). The majority of the important code is contained in the file named "bruh.cpp". The functionalities I programmed into the robot mainly revolved around its ball shooting capabilities. During the competition, our robot had to launch balls at a target. Included in this was vision processing, which I coded in to the robot to allow it to aim itself at a target using a "Limelight" camera. This allowed for increased accuracy over simply having the robot driver aim it themself. The methods which I coded are belonging to the Robot class and are named teleShoot, autoShoot, startAutoTarget, startTeleTarget, findTarget, and AutonomousPeriodic. In addition to this I also helped with some of the code in the TeleopPeriodic method. The methods that I wrote all use each other to aim the robot, and implement a Proportion Integral Derivative (PID) controller method to aim the robot without overadjusting.
  
  Quadcopter_with_PID: This is the code I have written thus far for a quadcopter drone I am currently building/programming using an Arduino Nano. It is controlled with a radio module that receives input data from a handheld controller. It utilizes a gyroscope/magnetometer/accelerometer in conjuction with a PID controller (similar to the one used above, but coded manually rather than using a library) to adjust the power sent to each motor (which controls a propellor). This is extremely important because even very small differences in the wiring of the motors can lead to significant variations in speed, and therefore the thrust that each motor will produce, so the PID controller is constantly adjusting the power distribution. The code itself works, I just need to zero in on the PID constants to allow the drone to hover and react quickly, but without oscillating too much.

  2420_FinalProject: In this project, I coded a binary tree object, and then created a method for balancing the tree to optimize average query time for each node. The user first specifies the number of nodes they want in the tree. The program then creates a tree with all numbers up to that number, inserting them in a random order. The program then balances the tree, and displays a percentage difference in the average node distance between the balanced and unbalanced trees.
  
  1410(FinalProject): In this project, I made a command line program that utilized a CSV file containing all production cars sold in the United States in 2020 to find the best car for a user to fit their needs based on certain preferances such as build, mileage, drivetrain, and so on. It implements a selection sort to sort cars based on horsepower, mileage, and price. The user is greated by a menu from which they can filter the list, sort the list, and do a google search for the cars currently in the list.
  
  
 Python:

  K-Means Clustering: In this program, I coded my own K-Means Clustering machine learning algorithm to classify three different types of iris flowers based on the length of their sepal and the width of their sepal. The program moves three different points, or centroids around the graph based on the data provided to locate them in the center of the three different flower clusters, and colors the flower data points based on the nearest centroid.

  BreastCancerClassifier: In this program, I used the K-Nearest Neighbors machine learning algorithm from the sklearn library to determine whether patients have breast cancer based on a myriad of factors that were recorded for each patient. The algorithm is then tested, and a graph is shown displaying its accuracy on a validation set of patients with a different number of "K-Nearest Neighbors". It can be seen that the accuracy of the algorithm reaches about 96.5% when K is set to 10. The algorithm can be tested on a different arrangment of the data by changing the random state in the code.
  
  
Java:

  DataVisualization: In this project, I created a binary search tree using Java rather than C++. I also coded a simple GUI that allows the user to select certain nodes on the tree, delete certain nodes, and insert new nodes.
  

JavaScript:

  ScoutingServer: This file contains code for a server taht I wrote in the file main.js. The purpose of this server is to receive data from an app that I created to assist in the scouting process of FRC competitions. The server receives data sent from devices using the app, and writes it to a CSV file to be used by another program that will interpret the data.
