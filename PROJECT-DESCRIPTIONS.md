# CS-Portfolio
Project Descriptions:

C++:

  K-NearestNeighbors: While doing research on different machine learning algorithms, I noticed that most machine learning libraries were written only for Python. Noting that, I challenged myself to write a machine learning algorithm "K-Nearest-Neighbors" using only C++. This program takes the data from a csv file of data for over 500 breast cancer tumors, and based on the data, determines whether a tumor is malignant or benign. The program creates "points" from each tumor, and places the first 95% points (practice points) from the dataset and graphs them on a normalized scale. Then, it tests itself by attempting to classify the last 5% of points (test points) from the dataset. It does this by taking the Euclidean distance for the data columns of each test point to all of the practice points. Then, based on a specified value "k", it takes the labels of the "k" nearest points, and determines the category (malignant/benign) of the test point based on which label has more instances within the "k" nearest points. In the program's current state, it classify tumors with an average of ~96% accuracy. While this program is not perfect, and not accurate enough to be used in real life applications, it shows the potential of machine learning (and more sophisticated algorithms) in the future and how it could be used in healthcare.

  FRC2020: This folder contains the code written for my high school's First Robotics Competition (FRC) robot. It was mostly written by a team of five people including me (I have omitted all portions of the code that I did not write myself). The majority of the important code is contained in the file named "bruh.cpp". The functionalities I programmed into the robot mainly revolved around its ball shooting capabilities. During the competition, our robot had to launch balls at a target. Included in this was vision processing, which I coded in to the robot to allow it to aim itself at a target using a "Limelight" camera. This allowed for increased accuracy over simply having the robot driver aim it themself. The methods which I coded are belonging to the Robot class and are named teleShoot, autoShoot, startAutoTarget, startTeleTarget, findTarget, and AutonomousPeriodic. In addition to this I also helped with some of the code in the TeleopPeriodic method. The methods that I wrote all use each other to aim the robot, and implement a Proportion Integral Derivative (PID) controller method to aim the robot without overadjusting.

  2420_FinalProject: In this project, I coded a binary tree object, and then created a method for balancing the tree to optimize average query time for each node. The user first specifies the number of nodes they want in the tree. The program then creates a tree with all numbers up to that number, inserting them in a random order. The program then balances the tree, and displays a percentage difference in the average node distance between the balanced and unbalanced trees.
  
  1410(FinalProject): In this project, I made a command line program that utilized a CSV file containing all production cars sold in the United States in 2020 to find the best car for a user to fit their needs based on certain preferances such as build, mileage, drivetrain, and so on. It implements a selection sort to sort cars based on horsepower, mileage, and price. The user is greated by a menu from which they can filter the list, sort the list, and do a google search for the cars currently in the list.
  
  Hashtable: This is a simple hashtable program that makes use of smart pointers to create a hashtable that sorts a specified number of random strings based on the first character in the string, which leads to improved search time over a basic array. The program creates the random strings and then displays the hashtable in the console.
  
  11.1_NoBrainer: This is where I originally coded my graph object and graph traversal methods. Running the program will only show the test results, and the Graph.h file shows most of the code worth looking at.
  
  
 Python:

  K-Means Clustering: In this program, I coded my own K-Means Clustering machine learning algorithm to classify three different types of iris flowers based on the length of their sepal and the width of their sepal. The program moves three different points, or centroids around the graph based on the data provided to locate them in the center of the three different flower clusters, and colors the flower data points based on the nearest centroid.

  BreastCancerClassifier: In this program, I used the K-Nearest Neighbors machine learning algorithm from the sklearn library to determine whether patients have breast cancer based on a myriad of factors that were recorded for each patient. The algorithm is then tested, and a graph is shown displaying its accuracy on a validation set of patients with a different number of "K-Nearest Neighbors". It can be seen that the accuracy of the algorithm reaches about 96.5% when K is set to 10. The algorithm can be tested on a different arrangment of the data by changing the random state in the code.
  
  
Java:

  DataVisualization: In this project, I created a binary search tree using Java rather than C++. I also coded a simple GUI that allows the user to select certain nodes on the tree, delete certain nodes, and insert new nodes.
  

JavaScript:

  ScoutingServer: This file contains code for a server taht I wrote in the file main.js. The purpose of this server is to receive data from an app that I created to assist in the scouting process of FRC competitions. The server receives data sent from devices using the app, and writes it to a CSV file to be used by another program that will interpret the data.
