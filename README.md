# CS-Portfolio
A portfolio of some of my programming projects that I feel showcase my skills as a programmer

Project Descriptions can be found in the PROJECT-DESCRIPTIONS.md file

***IMPORTANT

IF A CSV FILE IS INCLUDED IN THE FOLDER OF A PROJECT, IT IS MOST LIKELY REQUIRED FOR THAT PROJECT TO WORK
IF THERE IS A ZIP FILE CONTAINING CSV FILES FOR A PROJECT, PLACE THE CSV FILES INDIVIDUALLY IN THE WORKING DIRECTORY, NOT IN A FOLDER***
